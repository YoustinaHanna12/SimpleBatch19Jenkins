Approach to select the single checkbox:

 Inspect the checkbox.
 Write down the correct locator in the DOM.
 Use findElement to find the checkbox.
 Click on it.
 If you want to check whether the checkbox is selected or not:

 checkbox.isSelected(); // returns true if selected
 Preferred approach for selecting multiple checkboxes:

 Inspect them in the DOM.
 Write the locator in such a way that it is able to select all the required checkboxes.
 Use findElements to get all those checkboxes.
 Iterate through the list.
 While iterating, look for your desired checkbox (inspect the DOM to see which information provides you the indication that this is your desired checkbox).
 Use an if statement to make the selection.
